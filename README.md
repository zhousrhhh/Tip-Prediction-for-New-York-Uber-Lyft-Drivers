# Tip-Prediction-for-New-York-Uber-Lyft-Drivers

In this project, we identified drivers revenue's uncertainty as their pain points, proposed new product based on market needs, then translated business requirement to creative data solutions. 

The ultimate goal of our project is to construct a tip amount predictor for for-hire-vehicle (FHV) drivers, who are currently unable to know if each trip would incur a tip in the end beforehand. We decided on approaching this problem by utilizing machine learning methods, including regression, tree models and neural networks, to predict tip amount on features contained in our trips dataset and try to minimize prediction error by comparing the RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) among models.

Here are the key steps for the technical process:  
1. Data Cleaning
2. Visualization and Feature Selection
3. Modelling
- Regression
- Trees (XGBoost and GBM)
- Neural Networks
4. Result Discussion

Please check the [Python code](code.ipynb) and [discussion of technical details](Technical_Writup.pdf). 

As the outcome of this project, we designed UI/UX of this app plug-in productâ€™s prototype and presented the [business proposal](TipTok_Business_Proposal.pdf) to the hypothetical investors.
